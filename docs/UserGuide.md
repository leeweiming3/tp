--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `hirehub.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your HireHub.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar hirehub.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `add n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com c/HK p/61234567 t/Internal` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.<br>

* These are the constraints for each of the parameters (this applies to all commands):

  * NAME: cannot be blank, and only alphanumeric characters and spaces are allowed. In particular, special characters such as `/` and `-` and non-English characters (e.g. Chinese characters) are not allowed. This would be part of the planned improvements.
  * PHONE: cannot be blank and must adhere to the following constraints:
    * International phone numbers should contain a country code in front (+ followed by 1 to 3 digits), then a space, followed by a combination of digits, spaces, parentheses or hyphens with at least 3 digits.
    * If country code is omitted, it must be a valid Singapore phone number. It must start with 3, 6, 8 or 9 and must be in the following formats: `XXXXYYYY`, `XXXX-YYYY` or `XXXX YYYY`.
    * Other than the above constraints, there is no other validation to check if a country code is valid. Furthermore, given a country code, there is no phone validation specific to the country code. This would be part of the planned improvements.
  * EMAIL: must be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to the following constraints:
    * The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
    * This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods. The domain name must:
      - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
      - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
      - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.
  * COUNTRY: must be a valid ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 code which can be found from https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/. It is case-sensitive and must be in ALL CAPITALS. Alternatively, you can refer to the [appendix](#appendix-country-codes) for the exact ISO code to use for each country. Note that the value for country field shown on the UI is the English display name equivalent of the ISO code for user convenience, and what is actually stored in the backend is the ISO code.
  * TAG: cannot be blank (except in edit command), and only alphanumeric characters are allowed.
  * COMMENT: can be blank and does not have any constraints.
  * TITLE: cannot be blank and has a character limit of 100.
  * DESCRIPTION: can be blank and does not have any constraints.
  * VACANCY: must be a positive integer.
  * STATUS: must be one of the following 5 statuses (not case-sensitive): PRESCREEN, IN_PROGRESS, WAITLIST, OFFERED, REJECTED

* These are the primary key (i.e. no 2 items can have the same parameter) of candidates, jobs and applications respectively:
  * candidates: EMAIL
  * jobs: TITLE
  * applications: (EMAIL, TITLE) - either EMAIL or TITLE can be the same, as long as both are not the same.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the candidate list.

Format: `add n/NAME e/EMAIL c/COUNTRY p/PHONE [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com c/HK p/61234567`

### Adding an application: `add_app`

Adds a job application from a candidate to the application list.

Format: `add_app e/EMAIL ti/TITLE [s/STATUS]`

* The application added will contain the candidate with the specified email and the job with the specified title.
* If `STATUS` is omitted, then the `STATUS` of the application will be `PRESCREEN`.
* There cannot be 2 or more applications with the same pair of candidate and job.
* The addition of an application to a job will fail if any of these conditions are met:
    * The status of the application to be added is `OFFERED`, and the number of `OFFERED` applications to the job is already equal to the number of vacancies of the job.
    * The candidate list does not contain a candidate with the specified email.
    * The job list does not contain a job with the specified job title.

Examples:
* `add_app e/acekhoon@gmail.com ti/Quantitative Researcher`
* `add_app e/john@example.com ti/Software Engineer s/OFFERED`

### Edit candidate details: `edit`

Edits an existing candidate in the candidate list.

You can edit any of the valid candidate details including name, email, country and tags at the specified **INDEX**. Here, **INDEX** refers to the index number of candidates shown in the displayed candidate list.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [e/EMAIL] [c/COUNTRY] [p/PHONE] [t/TAG]…​`

---


* Even though you can edit multiple candidate details at once, attribute to edit must be **non-empty**. In other words, you must edit **at least one attribute** specified above.
* When **editing tags**, the existing tags of the candidate will be **removed**. Thus, you must specify **every tag** you want to keep on the candidate whenever you edit the candidate details.
* Applications involving the candidate to edit will be updated to involve the edited candidate.
* **Comment and Interview Status** field for the candidates **cannot be edited** by `edit` as there is a dedicated method for editing them separately.

---
Examples:
* `edit 24 n/Johnny Doe e/johnnydoe@gmail.com c/SG`

This command edits **name**, **email**, and **country of residence** of the candidate with index 24 to **Johnny Doe**, **johnnydoe@gmail.com**, and **Singapore**, respectively.


* `edit 8 n/Jeb Song e/jebsong@gmail.com t/IMOGold`

This command edits **name**, **email**, and the tag for **acceptance status** of the candidate with index 8 to **Jeb Song**, **jebsong@gmail.com**, and **IMOGold**, respectively. Note that the existing tag(s) on this candidate (if any) is/are completely removed and a new tag `IMOGold` is added.

---

If edit command is successfully executed, the app will display the edited candidate with the new attributes.

### Edit a job: `edit_job`

* Applications involving the job to edit will be updated to involve the edited job.
* Editing of the vacancy of a job will fail if the edited vacancy is less than the current number of applications to the job with `OFFERED` status.

---
### Adding a comment on a candidate: `comment`

Leaves comments on important points to note down for individual candidates during the recruitment process. This overwrites existing comment (if any) and displays the resulting candidate.

* `INDEX` must be within the range `1` to `n`, where `n` is the number of records in the database.

Format: `comment INDEX COMMENT`

Examples:
* `comment 3 Managed to solve every round 3 interview questions. He must be a strong candidate, potentially to be recruited as a quantitative research intern at Jane Street.`
* `comment 1` deletes the comment from candidate of index 1.

### Tag a candidate: `tag`

Appends the tag or tags to a candidate's list of tags.

You can list any number of tags greater than 0, and all of them will be added to the specified **INDEX**. Here, **INDEX** refers to the index number of candidates shown in the displayed candidate list.

Format: `delete_tag INDEX t/TAG [t/TAG]…​`

* At least one tag must be provided.
* The specified tag(s) must be in the candidate's list of tags.

Example:
* `delete_tag 1 t/ExceptionalWork t/IMOGold` removes these tags from the 1st candidate displayed.

### Change status of an application: `status`

Changes the interview status of an application.

Interview status must be one of the following: `PRESCREEN`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `WAITLIST`, `OFFERED`, `REJECTED`.
When an application is added, by default it has status `PRESCREEN`.

Format: `status INDEX STATUS`

* The status update to an application of a job will fail under this condition:
    * The status of the application to change to is `OFFERED`, and the number of `OFFERED` applications to the job is already equal to the number of vacancies of the job.

Example:
* `status 24 IN_PROGRESS` changes the status of the application with index 24 to `IN_PROGRESS`.

If status command is successfully executed, the app will display the application with the new status.

### Saving the data

HireHub data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data files

HireHub data are saved automatically as JSON files `[JAR file location]/data/hirehub.json`, `[JAR file location]/data/jobs.json` and `[JAR file location]/data/applications.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing those data files.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data files makes their format invalid, HireHub will discard all data and start with empty data files at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the files before editing them.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause HireHub to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data files only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data files it creates with the files that contain the data of your previous HireHub home folder.

**Q**: What is the difference between `edit` and `tag`?<br>
**A**: `edit` will overwrite any current tags with new tags, while `tag` will append the new tags to the current ones. For example, suppose that John is candidate 1 with tags `Internal` and `Waitlist`. `edit 1 t/QuantResearcher` will change John's tags to just `QuantResearcher`, while `tag t/QuantResearcher` will change John's tags to `Internal`, `Waitlist` and `QuantResearcher`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
